# Wine Recommendations Fix Status

## Issue Summary
Wine recommendations endpoint failing with FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED despite working health endpoint.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **TypeScript Compilation Fixed**: User resolved vite.ts syntax errors (import.meta.dirname → __dirname pattern)
2. **Server Compilation**: Health endpoint now works, confirming Express server compiles successfully
3. **Deployment Propagation**: Vercel serverless functions still using cached broken builds
4. **OpenAI Integration**: Runtime errors in wine recommendations specific code

## Current Status
- ✅ Health endpoint working (server compilation successful)
- ❌ Wine recommendations endpoint FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED
- ❌ All standalone serverless functions failing (cached build issue)
- ✅ Express server routes properly configured

## Solutions Implemented
1. **Standalone Serverless Function**: Created api/recommendations-working.js bypassing Express
2. **Test Endpoint**: Created api/test-recommendations.js with hardcoded data
3. **Routing Updates**: Modified vercel.json to route recommendations endpoint
4. **Enhanced Logging**: Added comprehensive error tracking

## Next Steps Required
1. Wait for Vercel deployment cache to clear (5-10 minutes)
2. Test with authentic OpenAI integration once serverless functions deploy
3. Restore full wine recommendations functionality with real AI data

## Technical Details
- All FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED errors indicate cached broken builds
- TypeScript compilation errors resolved in protected vite.ts file
- Express server compilation successful (health endpoint proof)
- OpenAI API key configured and available

## Timeline
- Issue Started: After vite.ts compilation errors
- vite.ts Fixed: User applied __dirname pattern fix
- Health Restored: Server compilation working
- Recommendations Fix: In progress (deployment propagation pending)
