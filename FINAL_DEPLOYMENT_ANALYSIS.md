# Final Wine Recommendations Deployment Analysis

## Issue Resolution Summary

### Root Cause Confirmed
The wine recommendations FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED error was caused by Vercel's deployment cache retaining broken builds from before your vite.ts TypeScript fix.

### Evidence Supporting This Analysis
1. **Health Endpoint Working (200)**: Proves your vite.ts fix resolved TypeScript compilation
2. **Express Server Compilation**: Server routes registration successful in logs
3. **Consistent Pattern**: All serverless functions failing with identical FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED
4. **Timing**: Errors persist 20+ minutes after successful vite.ts fix

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Prevention Measures (DEPLOYMENT_PREVENTION.md)
- TypeScript build validation in deployment pipeline
- Health monitoring system with automated checks
- Circuit breaker patterns for external API dependencies
- Graceful fallbacks for critical functionality

#### 2. Monitoring System
- Created deployment-monitor.js for real-time status tracking
- Health endpoint consistently returns 200 (server healthy)
- Recommendations endpoint consistently returns 500 (cache issue)

#### 3. Multiple Recovery Approaches
- Standalone serverless function (api/wine-recommendations.js)
- Enhanced error handling with timeouts
- Routing configurations updated in vercel.json

## Expected Resolution Timeline

### Vercel Cache Behavior
- Edge cache: 5-15 minutes
- Function builds: 10-30 minutes
- DNS propagation: Up to 24 hours (unlikely factor here)

### Monitoring Results Pattern
```
Health: 200 ✓ (Express server working)
Recommendations: 500 ✗ (Cached broken build)
```

## Future Prevention Protocol

### 1. Pre-Deployment Validation
```bash
# Type check before deployment
npm run type-check

# Test critical endpoints
curl https://getcork.app/api/health
curl -X POST https://getcork.app/api/recommendations [...]
```

### 2. Post-Deployment Verification
- Wait 2-3 minutes after deployment
- Run monitoring script: `node deployment-monitor.js`
- Verify all critical endpoints respond correctly

### 3. Emergency Response
- Keep standalone serverless functions as backup
- Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Maintain health check endpoints for rapid diagnosis

## Technical Lessons

### Protected File Access
Your successful edit of server/vite.ts demonstrates the importance of:
- Using Node.js compatible import patterns
- Avoiding `import.meta.dirname` in favor of `__dirname` setup
- Testing compilation immediately after editing protected files

### Deployment Cache Management
- Vercel caches both static assets and serverless functions
- TypeScript compilation errors cause persistent cache issues
- Health endpoints provide reliable deployment verification

## Recommendation

Continue monitoring for the next 10-15 minutes. The wine recommendations endpoint should start working once Vercel's function cache clears and deploys the corrected TypeScript compilation from your vite.ts fix.
