Issue Summary
I have a critical production error in my Clerk authentication flow. Users can successfully initiate sign-up but encounter an error specifically when submitting their completed profile creation form. This is blocking user onboarding entirely.
Required Analysis Steps
1. Error Identification & Logging

Examine all error logs: Check browser console, network tab, server logs, and any Clerk-specific logs
Identify the exact error message: Capture the full error stack trace, error codes, and any Clerk-specific error responses
Determine error timing: Pinpoint exactly when the error occurs (form validation, API call, redirect, etc.)
Network analysis: Inspect all HTTP requests/responses during profile submission, including status codes, headers, and payloads

2. Clerk Configuration Audit

Verify Clerk dashboard settings: Check sign-up flow configuration, required fields, and profile completion settings
Validate API keys: Ensure publishable and secret keys are correctly configured for production
Review webhook configurations: Check if any webhooks are failing or misconfigured
Examine Clerk component props: Verify all Clerk components have correct props and event handlers

3. Code Flow Analysis
Please trace through the complete user journey:

Sign-up initiation → Profile form display → Form completion → Submission → Error occurrence
Identify every function, API call, state change, and data transformation in this flow
Check for any custom validation, middleware, or interceptors that might be interfering

4. Data & State Investigation

Form data validation: Ensure all required fields are properly formatted and validated
State management: Check if user state, session state, or form state is corrupted
Database operations: Verify any user profile creation or update operations in the database
API endpoint functionality: Test all custom API endpoints involved in profile creation

5. Environment & Dependencies

Production environment check: Verify all environment variables are set correctly
Clerk SDK version: Ensure you're using a stable, compatible version
Dependency conflicts: Check for any package conflicts or version mismatches
CORS and security headers: Verify domain configurations and security settings

Debugging Constraints
What NOT to change:

Preserve existing functionality: Do not modify any working features or flows
Maintain current user experience: Keep all existing UI/UX intact except for the broken profile submission
Protect data integrity: Ensure no changes affect existing user data or database schemas
Preserve integrations: Don't alter other third-party integrations or services

Safe modification zones:

Error handling and logging improvements
Profile submission logic fixes
Clerk configuration corrections
Bug fixes that specifically address the identified error

Expected Output
Please provide:

Root Cause Analysis: Detailed explanation of what's causing the error
Minimal Fix Strategy: The smallest possible code changes needed to resolve the issue
Testing Verification: How to confirm the fix works without breaking other functionality
Rollback Plan: How to quickly revert changes if needed
Prevention Measures: Suggestions to prevent similar issues in the future

Additional Context

This is a production application with active users
I need a surgical fix that addresses only the broken functionality
The error is consistent and reproducible
All other authentication flows (sign-in, password reset, etc.) are working correctly

Please start by identifying the exact error and its root cause before proposing any solutions. Focus on precision over broad changes.
