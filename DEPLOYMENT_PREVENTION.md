# Deployment Prevention Measures

## Critical Issue Identified
Wine recommendations endpoint failing with FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED despite successful TypeScript compilation fix. Root cause: Vercel deployment cache retaining broken builds from before vite.ts syntax correction.

## Prevention Measures Implemented

### 1. Pre-Deployment Validation
- TypeScript compilation verification before any protected file edits
- Health endpoint monitoring to confirm Express server functionality
- Comprehensive testing protocol for critical endpoints

### 2. Cache Management Strategy
- Monitor deployment propagation delays (15-45 minutes typical)
- Use deployment IDs and cache-busting headers
- Maintain Express server routes as reliable fallbacks
- Document successful fix patterns for future reference

### 3. Emergency Response Protocol
- Standalone serverless function backups for critical endpoints
- Express server routing alternatives when serverless functions fail
- Graceful degradation patterns for external dependencies
- Real-time monitoring system for deployment verification

### 4. Development Safety Measures
- Protected file editing protocols (especially server/vite.ts)
- Immediate post-edit verification procedures
- Circuit breaker patterns for external API dependencies
- Comprehensive error logging and monitoring

## Deployment Best Practices

### Before Protected File Changes
1. Backup current working state
2. Verify TypeScript compilation: `npm run type-check`
3. Test critical endpoints functionality
4. Document expected changes and rollback plan

### After Protected File Changes
1. Immediate TypeScript compilation verification
2. Health endpoint confirmation (should return 200)
3. Monitor critical endpoints for 15-45 minutes
4. Verify deployment propagation completion
5. Document successful patterns for future use

### Cache Issue Resolution
- Expected timeline: 1-2 hours for full cache clearance
- Indicators: Health endpoint working, serverless functions failing
- Solution: Wait for cache propagation or implement Express server routing
- Prevention: Use deployment monitoring and staged rollouts
