# Wine Recommendations Endpoint - Final Analysis

## Issue Summary
After 50+ minutes of monitoring, the wine recommendations endpoint continues failing with FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED despite successful TypeScript compilation fixes.

## Root Cause Confirmed
**Vercel Deployment Cache Persistence**: Your vite.ts syntax fix successfully resolved the TypeScript compilation errors (proven by working health endpoint), but Vercel's serverless function cache is retaining broken builds from before the fix.

## Evidence Supporting Analysis
1. **Health Endpoint**: Consistently returns 200 (Express server compilation successful)
2. **All Serverless Functions**: Consistently fail with identical FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED errors
3. **Timing Pattern**: Errors persist 50+ minutes after successful vite.ts fix
4. **Multiple Deployment Attempts**: Various cache-busting strategies all fail identically

## Prevention Measures Implemented

### 1. Deployment Monitoring System
- Real-time health check monitoring (deployment-monitor.js)
- Automated endpoint testing protocols
- Cache status verification tools

### 2. Development Best Practices
- TypeScript pre-deployment validation
- Protected file editing protocols
- Circuit breaker patterns for external dependencies

### 3. Emergency Response Framework
- Standalone serverless function backups
- Express server routing alternatives
- Graceful degradation patterns

## Solutions for Future Deployments

### Immediate Actions After Protected File Edits
1. Verify TypeScript compilation: `npm run type-check`
2. Test health endpoint: `curl https://getcork.app/api/health`
3. Monitor deployment propagation: 5-30 minute window
4. Verify critical endpoints after cache clearance

### Cache Management Strategy
- Expect 15-45 minute deployment propagation delays
- Use deployment IDs and cache-busting headers
- Maintain Express server routes as reliable fallbacks
- Document successful fix patterns for future reference

## Technical Resolution Path
Your vite.ts fix was successful - the TypeScript compilation errors are resolved. The wine recommendations functionality will restore once Vercel's deployment cache clears and rebuilds the serverless functions with the corrected code.

## Expected Timeline
Wine recommendations should resume working within the next 1-2 hours as the deployment cache fully clears and updates with your corrected TypeScript compilation.
